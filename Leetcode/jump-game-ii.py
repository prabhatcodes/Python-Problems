# https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/

# Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
#
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
#
# Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
#
# You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
# Output: 2
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 105

""" first find out the len-1 of the array"""
