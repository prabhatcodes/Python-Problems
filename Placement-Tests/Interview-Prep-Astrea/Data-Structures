What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is simply a way of organising the data in such a way
that it can be used efficiently.

Way of defining, Storing and Retrieving of data in a structural &
systematic way.

Each data structure provides a particular way of organising data so
it can be accessed efficiently, depending on our use case.
We build our programs around these fundamental constructs(DS).

Different kinds of Data Structures are suited to different kinds of
applications, and some are highly specialised for specific tasks.
eg. Binary Trees -> Implementation of Databases
    Hashtables -> Used in Compiler implementations to look up
                   identifiers.
