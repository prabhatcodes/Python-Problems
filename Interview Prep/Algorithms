Recursion:
    Recursion is similar to repetition.
    The process in which a function calls itself directly or
    indirectly is called as recursion and such a function is
    known as a recursive function.

    How is a problem solved through recursion?

        The idea is to represent the problem in terms of one or more
        smaller problems, and add one or more base conditions to
        stop that recursion.
        eg. In case of FACTORIAL
            We know that factorial of n = n * factorial of n-1
            so the base case will be when n==0.
            we return when n=0.

        Wrong Base case:
            If a wrong base case is used, it may cause the program to
            run indefinitely and thus stack overflow error will be
            called.

     Indirect vs Direct Recursion:

        Direct: Function Calls itself
        Indirect:
